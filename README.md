# My version of Stephen Griders blog app from React Redux UDEMY course

Well similarly to a few people in the course, I have an issues with data dependency.  When I go to the Posts page, I am able to too see all the linked posts, I click on a post, my app navigates to the show post.  I see the details of the post, however when I hit refresh in my browser, it throws an error, and will no go past the loading..

The app doesn't seam to have a way to get back out to the posts and I am getting a 404 error on the post ID in the console.  

The console logs an error with undefined id.

This error effect the last (3) videos of the course dealing with PostsShow and DeletePost.

Looking for any help, Thank you.
